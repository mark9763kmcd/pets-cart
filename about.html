    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At Pet Delight, we believe in providing only the best food for your furry family members. With years of experience in pet nutrition, our mission is to support pets' health through all-natural, tasty, and safe meals.</p>
	<p>Our Story
PawPal Pet Foods was born from a deep love for animals and a mission to improve pet health through better nutrition. Our founders, a group of pet parents and veterinary nutritionists, came together in 2018 to develop food that’s both tasty and health-boosting for pets.
